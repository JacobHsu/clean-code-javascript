## **Variables**

### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other "falsy" values such as `''`, `""`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || "Hipster Brew Co.";
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = "Hipster Brew Co.") {
  // ...
}
```

## **Functions**

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

### Set default objects with Object.assign

**Bad:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || "Foo";
  config.body = config.body || "Bar";
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || "Baz";
  config.cancellable =
    config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: "Order",
  // User did not include 'body' key
  buttonText: "Send",
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  let finalConfig = Object.assign(
    {
      title: "Foo",
      body: "Bar",
      buttonText: "Baz",
      cancellable: true
    },
    config
  );
  return finalConfig
  // config now equals: {title: "Order", body: "Bar", buttonText: "Send", cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

### Don't use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that **this function does more than one thing.** Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}
```

### Avoid Side Effects (part 1)

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
let name = "Ryan McDermott";

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(" ");
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

console.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split(" ");
}

const name = "Ryan McDermott";
const newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
console.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)

In JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable 
(mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it's important 
to handle them carefully when they're passed as parameters to a function. A 
JavaScript function can change an object's properties or alter the contents of 
an array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.

Suppose there's a function that accepts an array parameter representing a 
shopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array - 
by adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that 
uses that same `cart` array will be affected by this addition. That may be 
great, however it could also be bad. Let's imagine a bad situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase" button which calls a `purchase` function that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because the `cart` array was modified.

A great solution would be for the `addItemToCart` function to always clone the 
`cart`, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still
using the old shopping cart wouldn't be affected by the changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:

1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
   but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
   are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

2. Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
   this isn't a big issue in practice because there are
   [great libraries](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) that allow
   this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
   it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};
```

### Favor functional programming over imperative programming

JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has
a functional flavor to it. Functional languages can be cleaner and easier to test.
Favor this style of programming when you can.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

let totalOutput = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < programmerOutput.length; i++) {
  totalOutput += programmerOutput[i].linesOfCode;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

const totalOutput = programmerOutput.reduce(
  (totalLines, output) => totalLines + output.linesOfCode,
  0
);
// https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
```
