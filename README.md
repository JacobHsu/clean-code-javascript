## **Variables**

### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other "falsy" values such as `''`, `""`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || "Hipster Brew Co.";
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = "Hipster Brew Co.") {
  // ...
}
```

## **Functions**

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```
