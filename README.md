## **Variables**

### Use searchable names

We will read more code than we will ever write. It's important that the code we
do write is readable and searchable. By _not_ naming variables that end up
being meaningful for understanding our program, we hurt our readers.
Make your names searchable. Tools like
[buddy.js](https://github.com/danielstjules/buddy.js) and
[ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/660e0918933e6e7fede26bc675a0763a6b357c94/docs/rules/no-magic-numbers.md)
can help identify unnamed constants.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// What the heck is 86400000 for?
setTimeout(blastOff, 86400000);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
// Declare them as capitalized named constants.
const MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY = 60 * 60 * 24 * 1000; //86400000;

setTimeout(blastOff, MILLISECONDS_PER_DAY);
```

### Use explanatory variables

**Bad:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
saveCityZipCode(
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[1],
  address.match(cityZipCodeRegex)[2]
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const address = "One Infinite Loop, Cupertino 95014";
const cityZipCodeRegex = /^[^,\\]+[,\\\s]+(.+?)\s*(\d{5})?$/;
const [_, city, zipCode] = address.match(cityZipCodeRegex) || [];
saveCityZipCode(city, zipCode);
```

### Use default arguments instead of short circuiting or conditionals

Default arguments are often cleaner than short circuiting. Be aware that if you
use them, your function will only provide default values for `undefined`
arguments. Other "falsy" values such as `''`, `""`, `false`, `null`, `0`, and
`NaN`, will not be replaced by a default value.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name) {
  const breweryName = name || "Hipster Brew Co.";
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createMicrobrewery(name = "Hipster Brew Co.") {
  // ...
}
```

## **Functions**

### Functions should do one thing

This is by far the most important rule in software engineering. When functions
do more than one thing, they are harder to compose, test, and reason about.
When you can isolate a function to just one action, it can be refactored
easily and your code will read much cleaner. If you take nothing else away from
this guide other than this, you'll be ahead of many developers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function emailClients(clients) {
  clients.forEach(client => {
    const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
    if (clientRecord.isActive()) {
      email(client);
    }
  });
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function emailActiveClients(clients) {
  clients.filter(isActiveClient).forEach(email);
}

function isActiveClient(client) {
  const clientRecord = database.lookup(client);
  return clientRecord.isActive();
}
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Set default objects with Object.assign

**Bad:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: null,
  body: "Bar",
  buttonText: null,
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  config.title = config.title || "Foo";
  config.body = config.body || "Bar";
  config.buttonText = config.buttonText || "Baz";
  config.cancellable =
    config.cancellable !== undefined ? config.cancellable : true;
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const menuConfig = {
  title: "Order",
  // User did not include 'body' key
  buttonText: "Send",
  cancellable: true
};

function createMenu(config) {
  let finalConfig = Object.assign(
    {
      title: "Foo",
      body: "Bar",
      buttonText: "Baz",
      cancellable: true
    },
    config
  );
  return finalConfig
  // config now equals: {title: "Order", body: "Bar", buttonText: "Send", cancellable: true}
  // ...
}

createMenu(menuConfig);
```

### Don't use flags as function parameters

Flags tell your user that **this function does more than one thing.** Functions should do one thing. Split out your functions if they are following different code paths based on a boolean.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function createFile(name, temp) {
  if (temp) {
    fs.create(`./temp/${name}`);
  } else {
    fs.create(name);
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function createFile(name) {
  fs.create(name);
}

function createTempFile(name) {
  createFile(`./temp/${name}`);
}
```

### Avoid Side Effects (part 1)

A function produces a side effect if it does anything other than take a value in
and return another value or values. A side effect could be writing to a file,
modifying some global variable, or accidentally wiring all your money to a
stranger.

Now, you do need to have side effects in a program on occasion. Like the previous
example, you might need to write to a file. What you want to do is to
centralize where you are doing this. Don't have several functions and classes
that write to a particular file. Have one service that does it. One and only one.

The main point is to avoid common pitfalls like sharing state between objects
without any structure, using mutable data types that can be written to by anything,
and not centralizing where your side effects occur. If you can do this, you will
be happier than the vast majority of other programmers.

**Bad:**

```javascript
// Global variable referenced by following function.
// If we had another function that used this name, now it'd be an array and it could break it.
let name = "Ryan McDermott";

function splitIntoFirstAndLastName() {
  name = name.split(" ");
}

splitIntoFirstAndLastName();

console.log(name); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name) {
  return name.split(" ");
}

const name = "Ryan McDermott";
const newName = splitIntoFirstAndLastName(name);

console.log(name); // 'Ryan McDermott';
console.log(newName); // ['Ryan', 'McDermott'];
```

### Avoid Side Effects (part 2)

In JavaScript, some values are unchangeable (immutable) and some are changeable 
(mutable). Objects and arrays are two kinds of mutable values so it's important 
to handle them carefully when they're passed as parameters to a function. A 
JavaScript function can change an object's properties or alter the contents of 
an array which could easily cause bugs elsewhere.

Suppose there's a function that accepts an array parameter representing a 
shopping cart. If the function makes a change in that shopping cart array - 
by adding an item to purchase, for example - then any other function that 
uses that same `cart` array will be affected by this addition. That may be 
great, however it could also be bad. Let's imagine a bad situation:

The user clicks the "Purchase" button which calls a `purchase` function that
spawns a network request and sends the `cart` array to the server. Because
of a bad network connection, the `purchase` function has to keep retrying the
request. Now, what if in the meantime the user accidentally clicks an "Add to Cart"
button on an item they don't actually want before the network request begins?
If that happens and the network request begins, then that purchase function
will send the accidentally added item because the `cart` array was modified.

A great solution would be for the `addItemToCart` function to always clone the 
`cart`, edit it, and return the clone. This would ensure that functions that are still
using the old shopping cart wouldn't be affected by the changes.

Two caveats to mention to this approach:

1. There might be cases where you actually want to modify the input object,
   but when you adopt this programming practice you will find that those cases
   are pretty rare. Most things can be refactored to have no side effects!

2. Cloning big objects can be very expensive in terms of performance. Luckily,
   this isn't a big issue in practice because there are
   [great libraries](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/) that allow
   this kind of programming approach to be fast and not as memory intensive as
   it would be for you to manually clone objects and arrays.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  cart.push({ item, date: Date.now() });
};
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const addItemToCart = (cart, item) => {
  return [...cart, { item, date: Date.now() }];
};
```

### Favor functional programming over imperative programming

JavaScript isn't a functional language in the way that Haskell is, but it has
a functional flavor to it. Functional languages can be cleaner and easier to test.
Favor this style of programming when you can.

**Bad:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

let totalOutput = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < programmerOutput.length; i++) {
  totalOutput += programmerOutput[i].linesOfCode;
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
const programmerOutput = [
  {
    name: "Uncle Bobby",
    linesOfCode: 500
  },
  {
    name: "Suzie Q",
    linesOfCode: 1500
  },
  {
    name: "Jimmy Gosling",
    linesOfCode: 150
  },
  {
    name: "Gracie Hopper",
    linesOfCode: 1000
  }
];

const totalOutput = programmerOutput.reduce(
  (totalLines, output) => totalLines + output.linesOfCode,
  0
);
// https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/Reduce
```

### Encapsulate conditionals

**Bad:**

```javascript
if (fsm.state === "fetching" && isEmpty(listNode)) {
  // ...
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function shouldShowSpinner(fsm, listNode) {
  return fsm.state === "fetching" && isEmpty(listNode);
}

if (shouldShowSpinner(fsmInstance, listNodeInstance)) {
  // ...
}
```

### Avoid type-checking (part 1)

JavaScript is untyped, which means your functions can take any type of argument.
Sometimes you are bitten by this freedom and it becomes tempting to do
type-checking in your functions. There are many ways to avoid having to do this.
The first thing to consider is consistent APIs.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  if (vehicle instanceof Bicycle) {
    vehicle.pedal(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  } else if (vehicle instanceof Car) {
    vehicle.drive(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
  }
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function travelToTexas(vehicle) {
  vehicle.move(this.currentLocation, new Location("texas"));
}
```

### Avoid type-checking (part 2)

If you are working with basic primitive values like strings and integers,
and you can't use polymorphism but you still feel the need to type-check,
you should consider using TypeScript. It is an excellent alternative to normal
JavaScript, as it provides you with static typing on top of standard JavaScript
syntax. The problem with manually type-checking normal JavaScript is that
doing it well requires so much extra verbiage that the faux "type-safety" you get
doesn't make up for the lost readability. Keep your JavaScript clean, write
good tests, and have good code reviews. Otherwise, do all of that but with
TypeScript (which, like I said, is a great alternative!).

**Bad:**

```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  if (
    (typeof val1 === "number" && typeof val2 === "number") ||
    (typeof val1 === "string" && typeof val2 === "string")
  ) {
    return val1 + val2;
  }

  throw new Error("Must be of type String or Number");
}
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function combine(val1, val2) {
  return val1 + val2;
}
```

## **Objects and Data Structures**

### Use getters and setters

Using getters and setters to access data on objects could be better than simply
looking for a property on an object. "Why?" you might ask. Well, here's an
unorganized list of reasons why:

- When you want to do more beyond getting an object property, you don't have
  to look up and change every accessor in your codebase.
- Makes adding validation simple when doing a `set`.
- Encapsulates the internal representation.
- Easy to add logging and error handling when getting and setting.
- You can lazy load your object's properties, let's say getting it from a
  server.

**Bad:**

```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // ...

  return {
    balance: 0
    // ...
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.balance = 100;
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function makeBankAccount() {
  // this one is private
  let balance = 0;

  // a "getter", made public via the returned object below
  function getBalance() {
    return balance;
  }

  // a "setter", made public via the returned object below
  function setBalance(amount) {
    // ... validate before updating the balance
    balance = amount;
  }

  return {
    // ...
    getBalance,
    setBalance
  };
}

const account = makeBankAccount();
account.setBalance(100);
```

### Make objects have private members

This can be accomplished through closures (for ES5 and below).

**Bad:**

```javascript
const Employee = function(name) {
  this.name = name;
};

Employee.prototype.getName = function getName() {
  return this.name;
};

const employee = new Employee("John Doe");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: undefined
```

**Good:**

```javascript
function makeEmployee(name) {
  return {
    getName() {
      return name;
    }
  };
}

const employee = makeEmployee("John Doe");
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
delete employee.name;
console.log(`Employee name: ${employee.getName()}`); // Employee name: John Doe
```

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

This principle states two essential things:

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
   depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend on
   abstractions.

This can be hard to understand at first, but if you've worked with AngularJS,
you've seen an implementation of this principle in the form of Dependency
Injection (DI). While they are not identical concepts, DIP keeps high-level
modules from knowing the details of its low-level modules and setting them up.
It can accomplish this through DI. A huge benefit of this is that it reduces
the coupling between modules. Coupling is a very bad development pattern because
it makes your code hard to refactor.

As stated previously, JavaScript doesn't have interfaces so the abstractions
that are depended upon are implicit contracts. That is to say, the methods
and properties that an object/class exposes to another object/class. In the
example below, the implicit contract is that any Request module for an
`InventoryTracker` will have a `requestItems` method.

**Bad:**

```javascript
class InventoryRequester {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = ["HTTP"];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

class InventoryTracker {
  constructor(items) {
    this.items = items;

    // BAD: We have created a dependency on a specific request implementation.
    // We should just have requestItems depend on a request method: `request`
    this.requester = new InventoryRequester();
  }

  requestItems() {
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      this.requester.requestItem(item);
    });
  }
}

const inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker(["apples", "bananas"]);
inventoryTracker.requestItems();
```

**Good:**

```javascript
class InventoryTracker {
  constructor(items, requester) {
    this.items = items;
    this.requester = requester;
  }

  requestItems() {
    this.items.forEach(item => {
      this.requester.requestItem(item);
    });
  }
}

class InventoryRequesterV1 {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = ["HTTP"];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

class InventoryRequesterV2 {
  constructor() {
    this.REQ_METHODS = ["WS"];
  }

  requestItem(item) {
    // ...
  }
}

// By constructing our dependencies externally and injecting them, we can easily
// substitute our request module for a fancy new one that uses WebSockets.
const inventoryTracker = new InventoryTracker(
  ["apples", "bananas"],
  new InventoryRequesterV2()
);
inventoryTracker.requestItems();
```

## **Concurrency**

### Use Promises, not callbacks

Callbacks aren't clean, and they cause excessive amounts of nesting. With ES2015/ES6,
Promises are a built-in global type. Use them!

**Bad:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request";
import { writeFile } from "fs";

get(
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin",
  (requestErr, response, body) => {
    if (requestErr) {
      console.error(requestErr);
    } else {
      writeFile("article.html", body, writeErr => {
        if (writeErr) {
          console.error(writeErr);
        } else {
          console.log("File written");
        }
      });
    }
  }
);
```

**Good:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request-promise";
import { writeFile } from "fs-extra";

get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin")
  .then(body => {
    return writeFile("article.html", body);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("File written");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

**[⬆ back to top](#table-of-contents)**

### Async/Await are even cleaner than Promises

Promises are a very clean alternative to callbacks, but ES2017/ES8 brings async and await
which offer an even cleaner solution. All you need is a function that is prefixed
in an `async` keyword, and then you can write your logic imperatively without
a `then` chain of functions. Use this if you can take advantage of ES2017/ES8 features
today!

**Bad:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request-promise";
import { writeFile } from "fs-extra";

get("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin")
  .then(body => {
    return writeFile("article.html", body);
  })
  .then(() => {
    console.log("File written");
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

**Good:**

```javascript
import { get } from "request-promise";
import { writeFile } from "fs-extra";

async function getCleanCodeArticle() {
  try {
    const body = await get(
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cecil_Martin"
    );
    await writeFile("article.html", body);
    console.log("File written");
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
  }
}

getCleanCodeArticle()
```
